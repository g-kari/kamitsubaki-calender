## How it works

This calendar solves CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues by using GitHub Actions to fetch event data from external sources and store it locally:

1. **GitHub Action** (`/.github/workflows/update-events.yml`) runs daily at 9:00 AM JST
2. **Fetch Script** (`/scripts/fetch-events.js`) attempts to retrieve latest event data from KAMITSUBAKI's official website
3. **Local Storage** (`/data/events.json`) stores the fetched event data
4. **Web Application** (`index.html`) loads event data from the local JSON file instead of making cross-origin requests

## Setup

The application works out of the box with the provided initial event data. The GitHub Action will automatically update the event data daily.

### Manual Testing

To manually run the update script:

```bash
npm install cheerio node-fetch@2
node scripts/fetch-events.js
```
